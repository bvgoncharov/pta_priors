Dataset derived by Goncharov et al. (2020) and Reardon et al. (2020).

Modifications:
1. In j1713+0747.par I commented "SINI KIN" and uncommented "SINI 0.95141109093653911815". Otherwise, I got log-likelihood always equal to -inf, after I fix EFAC, EQUAD and ECORR. It did not happen when I fixed only two of the three white noise parameters (per backend).
